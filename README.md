# Job Interview Code Test for Homekynd - React Project with Three.js

This project is a code test designed to assess technical skills using technologies like React, Vite, and react-three-fiber for integrating Three.js.

## Description

The project is a web application developed with React. I've opted for Vite as the build tool for quick and efficient setup of the development environment.

I use react-three-fiber, a React binding library for Three.js, to integrate 3D graphics into the application.

## Features

- **API Integration**: Connects to the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch data about people and planets.
- **3D Visualization**: I utilize Three.js to create and render 3D elements within the application.
- **Interactivity**: The application provides interaction with the 3D models, allowing users to explore and manipulate objects by clicking or hovering over them.
